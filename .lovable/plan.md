# Plan: Regenerate Video with Wider Composition and Updated Devices

## Overview

Update the background video to be significantly more zoomed out, ensuring devices remain visible on all screen sizes including mobile. Switch to modern Apple devices and add a humane pin, digital pendent kinda device  as a thematic element.

## Video Specifications

### Composition
- **Ultra-wide establishing shot** - camera pulled back much further than current version
- Devices positioned in the **lower 15-20% of frame** so they remain visible even when video is cropped on mobile
- Landscape (meadow, mountains, sky) fills **80-85% of frame**
- Ensure devices are visible at any aspect ratio (16:9, 4:3, 9:16 mobile)

### Devices (Updated)
- **Latest MacBook Pro** - closed or slightly open, screen dark/cracked
- **Latest iPhone** - face down or with cracked screen, clearly not in use
- **humane pin, digital pendent kind of device  r** - adds interesting texture, showing latest voice led AI devices not in use, discarded
- All devices: clean but clearly abandoned/not functional
- Placed on natural surface (grass, rocks) in a natural scattered arrangement

### Lighting & Movement (Keep Current Elements)
- **Golden hour sunlight** with subtle warmth changes
- **Light rays shifting** through the scene (keep this effect)
- Gentle grass and plants swaying slowly in breeze
- Soft clouds drifting very slowly
- Seamless loop

## Technical Change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `src/assets/hero-bg.mp4` | Regenerate with ultra-wide composition, modern devices (MacBook Pro, iPhone, voice recorder), maintain shifting sunlight effect |

## Expected Result

- Serene, expansive landscape as the dominant visual
- Modern devices (Mac, iPhone, voice recorder) visible but small in frame
- Devices always visible regardless of screen size or aspect ratio
- Beautiful golden hour lighting with subtle sun movement
- Professional, cinematic quality matching the brand aesthetic
